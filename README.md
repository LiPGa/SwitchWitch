“Burn the witch!”, people are screaming and marching like armies. To protect your home, you need to pick up the magic that you sworn to never use again. You must think carefully and plan ahead because your strength only allows you to switch the enemy formations several times. You’ve got to scramble them up and foil their plan! 

A game developed by Nintendon't for CS 4152/5152 at Cornell University.

Our game is a light strategy game that will be released on iOS on May 21st 2022.

## Current Progress

### Gameplay Prototype

The programmers worked primarily on creating the gameplay prototype. We implemented all the models that will be used in the game. We constructed a visualization of the board using scene-nodes in the prototype. We also attempted to implement the combat mechanics into the prototype but were unable to do so on time.On the design side, designers did the character design for the player (witch), basic units (soldiers), and special units (archers, swordsmen, and warriors). In addition, the designers designed the UI interface and drafted the animation for the archers.
